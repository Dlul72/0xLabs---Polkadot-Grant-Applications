eventflo

## üåü Project Overview

eventflo is building the first unified, AI-driven, blockchain-powered event platform designed to transform the $1.5 trillion global event industry. By seamlessly integrating Web3 technologies with AI-enhanced event management, eventflo addresses key challenges such as ticket fraud, high operational costs, and fragmented tools while unlocking new revenue opportunities for organizers and immersive experiences for attendees. The platform leverages FloCoin to power an on-chain ticketing economy, providing real-world utility through fraud-proof transactions, resale transparency, tokenized event assets, and loyalty programs. eventflo bridges Web2 and Web3 audiences with a frictionless experience that drives mass adoption of blockchain-based event solutions. Its AI agent, Eva, automates event operations, optimizes marketing and pricing, and enhances engagement, delivering unprecedented efficiency and profitability. By creating an ecosystem where organizers, attendees, and investors can participate in shaping the future of events, eventflo is poised to redefine how events are created, experienced, and monetized.

## üîç Project Details

eventflo employs a sophisticated technology stack to deliver a secure, scalable, and user-friendly platform. The frontend leverages NextJs, Nodejs, React, Typescript, EthersJs, and Wagmi for seamless Web2/Web3 integration. The backend utilizes Go, Gin, Protobuf, Solidity, MongoDB, and Redis, ensuring robust performance and reliability. APIs are deployed via AWS Lambda, with storage and hosting on AWS S3, Vercel, and Infura. Smart contracts govern ticket issuance, resale, royalties, and tokenized event assets, while AI-driven components power real-time demand forecasting, fraud detection, and personalized marketing. eventflo‚Äôs architecture prioritizes user experience, with social logins, automatic wallet creation, and fiat-crypto interoperability enabling frictionless onboarding. Proprietary elements, such as the AI-driven pricing engine and tokenized ticketing economy, provide a competitive edge, though certain components like smart contract standards may be open-sourced to promote industry-wide adoption. eventflo does not aim to be a generic NFT marketplace or ticketing SaaS; its focus is on delivering a vertically integrated, AI-enhanced, blockchain-native event ecosystem.

## üß© Ecosystem Fit

eventflo fits within the Polkadot ecosystem as a powerful real-world application that bridges mainstream adoption and Web3 innovation. By integrating blockchain-based ticketing, decentralized insurance, and tokenized event infrastructure, eventflo expands the utility of blockchain technology beyond niche communities. Its target audience includes event organizers, sports leagues, festivals, entertainment brands, and attendees seeking greater transparency, security, and engagement. eventflo‚Äôs seamless Web2/Web3 UX ensures accessibility for non-crypto-native users while unlocking new monetization and ownership models through FloCoin. Existing blockchain-based ticketing solutions, such as GET Protocol and SeatlabNFT, lack the full-stack integration, AI-powered optimization, and token economy that eventflo delivers. Traditional players like Ticketmaster remain centralized, with opaque processes and high fees. eventflo‚Äôs differentiated approach combines AI-driven efficiency with transparent, on-chain governance, creating a superior value proposition and fostering mass adoption. Its emphasis on interoperability and cross-chain expansion further aligns with the Polkadot vision of a connected, user-centric Web3 ecosystem.
