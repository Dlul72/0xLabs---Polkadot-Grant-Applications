## üìù Name of your Project
Colb Finance

## üåü Project Overview

Colb Finance is a pioneering Swiss-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that democratizes access to premium real-world asset (RWA) investments by leveraging blockchain technology. The project empowers both institutional and retail investors to seamlessly access sophisticated investment strategies through tokenized structured products (TKSPs) and the $USC stablecoin. Colb bridges the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance by offering legally protected, fully compliant, and transparent on-chain investment opportunities. By removing conventional barriers such as high minimum investments and geographical restrictions, Colb enables inclusive participation in wealth management. The platform‚Äôs partnerships with leading blockchain ecosystems, including Moonbeam and Solana, as well as traditional financial institutions like Cit√© Gestion and NS Partners, further enhance its cross-chain capabilities and institutional trust. Colb‚Äôs mission is rooted in fostering transparency, security, and efficiency in asset management while driving the adoption of Wealth 3.0‚Äîushering a new era of decentralized, compliant, and equitable investment access.

## üîç Project Details

Colb‚Äôs technology stack is architected to support a robust and scalable investment platform. The frontend leverages NextJs, React, and Typescript, while the backend is powered by NextJs, PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM, and NodeJs. The blockchain layer utilizes Solidity, Typescript, EthersJs, and Wagmi, currently supporting Polygon and Moonbeam networks, with further multi-chain expansion planned. Smart contracts are developed to ensure secure tokenization and settlement of RWAs, fully integrated with Swiss-compliant legal frameworks. While the project is currently not open source, it has a strong commitment to transparency and regulatory compliance, operating under the supervision of Swiss financial intermediary ARIF and engaging in regular smart contract audits through partners like Chainalysis and Eleks. Colb‚Äôs architecture is designed for non-custodial access, enabling investors to retain direct control of their assets through web-based applications integrated with personal wallets. The project does not aim to become a consumer-facing neobank or a generic DeFi yield aggregator; its focus remains on delivering institutional-grade, legally sound tokenized investment products and stablecoins.

## üß© Ecosystem Fit

Colb Finance plays a transformative role within the Polkadot ecosystem and broader Web3 landscape by bridging institutional-grade investment products with decentralized networks. The platform specifically addresses the growing demand among DAOs, crypto-native treasuries, and individual investors for compliant, transparent, and yield-generating RWA exposure on-chain. Its target audience includes institutional investors, foundations, DAOs, and professional investors from emerging markets seeking secure alternatives to traditional banking and investment channels. While several projects exist in the RWA tokenization space, such as Ondo Finance and Centrifuge, Colb differentiates itself through its comprehensive control of the investment lifecycle‚Äîfrom asset sourcing to tokenization and distribution‚Äîcombined with Swiss regulatory robustness and a bankruptcy-remote legal structure. Moreover, Colb‚Äôs non-custodial, WebApp-enabled access and multi-asset wealth management strategies provide a broader and more sophisticated offering than niche players focused solely on fixed income or SME lending. The absence of fully compliant and versatile platforms in Switzerland gives Colb a strategic first-mover advantage in this market.
