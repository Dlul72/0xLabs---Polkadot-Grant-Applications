## üìù Name of your Project
SEED.Photo

## üåü Project Overview

SEED.Photo is a decentralized photography platform designed to empower creative professionals by providing them with a blockchain-based ecosystem where they can securely showcase, license, and sell their work. The platform directly addresses the long-standing challenges faced by photographers, including ownership verification, copyright protection, and unfair revenue models imposed by traditional stock agencies. SEED.Photo offers a transparent and fair tokenized economy, ensuring photographers retain control and maximize earnings from their art. The platform‚Äôs innovative features include free minting and listing, multi-chain support, raw file verification, and AI-driven discovery tools. Through strategic partnerships with universities, galleries, and blockchain networks, SEED.Photo is expanding photography‚Äôs presence in Web3 while bridging the gap between traditional creatives and decentralized technologies. With over 207,000 token holders, a mini app population exceeding one million, and an active global community, SEED.Photo is poised to redefine digital photography ownership and monetization.

## üîç Project Details

SEED.Photo‚Äôs technology stack is built for scalability and user-centric design. The backend leverages ASP.net Core and SQL Server to ensure robust data management and performance. The frontend is developed with Next.js to deliver a seamless web experience, while the mobile app is built on Flutter to ensure cross-platform compatibility. Smart contracts governing NFTs, licensing, and royalties are written in Solidity. SEED.Photo‚Äôs architecture integrates AI APIs for automated NFT descriptions, enhancing searchability and engagement. The platform supports multi-chain transactions across BNB, Ethereum, Polygon, and SUI, with planned expansion to additional networks. Features such as free gas reimbursement for creators, dedicated IPFS storage, raw file uploads, and blockchain bridges make SEED.Photo a superior solution for photographers. The platform does not aim to become a generic NFT marketplace or a traditional stock photo site; rather, it is a specialized Web3 ecosystem focused on authenticity, artist empowerment, and cross-chain NFT utility.

## üß© Ecosystem Fit

SEED.Photo plays a transformative role in the Polkadot ecosystem by introducing blockchain-powered digital rights management and revenue models to the creative sector. Its target audience spans professional photographers, digital artists, collectors, and photography enthusiasts worldwide. By enabling true ownership and transparent licensing through NFTs, SEED.Photo addresses critical gaps in traditional and existing NFT platforms. Competing platforms such as SuperRare, Foundation, and OpenSea lack SEED.Photo‚Äôs focused approach to photography, multi-chain operability, and unique features like raw file verification and tokenized revenue sharing through the Museum rental model. SEED.Photo also fosters new on-chain activity through automated royalties, staking, and gamified engagement. The platform‚Äôs integration of AI and cross-marketplace capabilities further distinguishes it from generic NFT solutions. By bridging Web2 creators with Web3 innovations, SEED.Photo drives adoption and transaction volume, expanding the blockchain ecosystem‚Äôs reach into creative industries.
