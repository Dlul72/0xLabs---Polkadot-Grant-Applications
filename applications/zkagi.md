## üìù Name of your Project
ZkAGI

## üåü Project Overview

ZkAGI empowers self-custodial automations for sovereign entrepreneurs through privacy-preserving AI infrastructure and agentic tooling. The project bridges the gap between decentralized AI, blockchain, and real-world applications by enabling developers to build privacy-centric AI agents using open-source models. ZkAGI addresses the limitations of centralized AI systems by providing a low-code/no-code agent builder, supporting private AI computations, and enabling verifiable on-chain actions. The platform enhances user experience while respecting data privacy and sovereignty. Currently, ZkAGI powers a global community of over 100,000 members, has secured 100+ Web3 partnerships, and is driving live integrations with multiple blockchain ecosystems. Its modular infrastructure facilitates scalable AI agent creation and fosters broad adoption across crypto-enabled regions such as China, Korea, Vietnam, Turkey, Africa, India, and the USA.

## üîç Project Details

ZkAGI is built with a highly modular tech stack optimized for decentralized AI computation and blockchain integration. The frontend leverages Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, and ShadcnUI. The backend stack includes Node.js, Python, Rust, and Ray Framework for GPU clustering, with Solidity used for smart contract interactions. The platform employs federated learning and Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZKML) to ensure privacy-preserving AI model training and inference. ZkAGI OS powers a decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) of compute nodes, enabling verifiable AI execution and agentic automation. The ZkAGI Agent Builder simplifies the creation of AI agents that interact with both Web2 and Web3 services. ZkAGI‚Äôs Zynapse API supports the integration of time-series models, LLMs, and specialized ML models into agents. The ecosystem is driven by the forthcoming $ZKAGI token, which enables human-to-machine, machine-to-machine, and machine-to-human payments for AI computations and training.

## üß© Ecosystem Fit

ZkAGI brings powerful value to the Polkadot ecosystem by enabling privacy-preserving AI agents that can autonomously interact with blockchain protocols. The platform offers Web3-native agentic tooling to enhance user onboarding, trading automation, wallet management, and cross-chain interoperability. ZkAGI‚Äôs integration with Zero-Knowledge Proofs ensures verifiable AI execution, fostering trust in AI-driven on-chain actions. Unlike competitors such as Bittensor, Virtuals, and GPU.net, ZkAGI differentiates itself through a cost-efficient, decentralized architecture with open-source ethos and no hardware constraints for participation. The project aligns with Polkadot‚Äôs goals of scalability, privacy, and interoperability by offering developer-friendly infrastructure and sophisticated agent-building tools. ZkAGI‚Äôs roadmap includes launching advanced agent kits, scaling enterprise integrations, and enabling trading volumes via agentic wallets‚Äîthereby driving increased user activity and liquidity across the Polkadot ecosystem.
