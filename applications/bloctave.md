Bloctave

## üåü Project Overview

Bloctave is transforming the music industry‚Äôs royalty distribution model by enabling real-time, transparent, and automated payments to rightsholders. Through its innovative settlement infrastructure and deep integration with licensing bodies, Bloctave solves the long-standing problem of delayed and opaque royalty payments. Traditionally, rightsholders have waited months or even years to receive remuneration for their work, often with little to no transparency. Bloctave addresses this by leveraging advanced audio fingerprinting, instant settlement technology, and Web3-ready architecture. Our solution enables royalty distributions to be executed in real time, directly to artists‚Äô wallets, with complete traceability and the ability to listen back to each broadcasted track. We have secured a partnership with a government-licensed music licensing monopoly, making us the first blockchain-integrated platform in this regulated space. Our long-term goal is to offer a fully decentralized, Web3-native framework that can handle hundreds of millions of micro-transactions daily, enhancing efficiency and trust for all stakeholders in the music industry.

## üîç Project Details

Bloctave is built using a robust technology stack that includes NextJS for the front end, ElysiaJS and Bun for the backend, and Cloudflare Workers and GraphQL for serverless infrastructure and data management. The blockchain component is being developed in Solidity and tested on Polygon (MATIC). Our architecture is designed to support high-volume, low-latency royalty settlements while ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks. At its core, the platform utilizes audio fingerprinting and smart contract technology to automate royalty tracking, calculation, and distribution. We currently maintain a partial build of the product that includes these blockchain elements and is available on GitHub at https://github.com/bloctave/RadioDist-main.

We are not developing a general-purpose music streaming service or a consumer-facing audio platform. Instead, our focus is strictly on infrastructure for backend royalty payments and reporting. Mockups, finalized APIs, and data model documentation are under development as we refine our MVP for integration with industry partners. The product is designed to serve institutional clients like Music Licensing Companies (MLCs), rather than general consumers.

## üß© Ecosystem Fit

Bloctave occupies a unique niche in the Polkadot ecosystem by addressing a long-underserved segment: broadcast royalty payments. Our application fits within the infrastructure and enterprise layer, offering an auditable and trustless settlement mechanism for legally required transactions. Our target audience consists primarily of Music Licensing Companies, royalty collection societies, and digital service providers that manage or remit royalties to rightsholders. By eliminating inefficiencies in current systems, Bloctave enables these organizations to modernize and reduce operational overheads. While there are DeFi music platforms in the broader blockchain space, none have established contracts with government-licensed MLCs or operate within such stringent regulatory environments. This makes Bloctave‚Äôs presence not only innovative but foundational for bridging traditional media and Web3 infrastructure. Our solution is not about creating a new music economy but improving the infrastructure that supports the existing one.

### Team's experience

Jonny Solomons has over a decade of experience in the media and entertainment industry, with a particular focus over the last three years on royalty management for a major royalty distribution organization. Robert Dabrowski brings 12 years of experience in financial services, including roles at systemically important banks and payment companies. Both founders previously collaborated on multiple ventures, combining domain-specific insights with financial infrastructure expertise. They are supported by senior blockchain developers who have architected and maintained systems managing hundreds of millions of dollars in digital assets. Corentin Cadieu - Advisor & Web 3 Serial Entrepreneur is also supporting the project as an advisor.

## üìä Development Status

Bloctave has been in active development since mid-2024 and has already produced a partial working version of the platform, with blockchain elements built in Solidity and deployed on Polygon. This repository is accessible at https://github.com/bloctave/RadioDist-main. The system is currently in pilot phase with a government-licensed music licensing entity and is generating early revenue. We have entered stealth mode with respect to our broader product features, but aim to finalize blockchain integration as part of this grant application.

## üìÖ Development Roadmap

### Overview

- **Estimated Duration:** 3 months
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 2
- **Total Costs:** $9,000

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | MIT |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation and a basic tutorial that explains how music royalty tracking and payment workflows are processed via smart contracts. |
| 0c. | Testing and Testing Guide | We will include comprehensive unit tests for smart contract logic and API endpoints, along with instructions on how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Article | We will publish a technical article explaining the implementation of our blockchain settlement infrastructure within Bloctave. |
| 1. | Feature X | We will build and deploy smart contracts for real-time royalty settlements, including test transactions for audio usage recognition events. |
| 2. | Feature Y | We will implement backend services to link audio fingerprint data to blockchain events and simulate payment routing to rightsholder wallets. |
| 3. | Feature Z | We will conduct final QA and load testing on the smart contracts, ensure integration with our frontend dashboard, and prepare regulatory compliance documentation for Web3 integration. |

### üí∞ Budget Breakdown

| Milestone | Deliverables | Cost (USD) | Estimated Completion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Features X, Y | $5,000 | 1.5 months |
| 2 | Feature Z | $4,000 | 1.5 months |
| **Total** | | **$9,000** | **3 months** |

## üîÆ Future Plans

Following completion of the Fast-Grant, we plan to continue development through a two-phase strategy. Phase 1 is focused on using seed grants such as this one to build out our blockchain settlement infrastructure and pilot it with our government-licensed MLC partner. Phase 2 involves pursuing $1M+ growth grants and equity funding to scale the platform across other jurisdictions, expand functionality, and achieve full Web3 compliance. We are actively preparing to close a VC-led funding round and aim to expand our technical team to support integration with additional networks and regulatory bodies. Our vision is for Bloctave to become the default protocol layer for rightsholder remuneration across the global music licensing ecosystem, starting with our strategic partner.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Information

We are currently in stealth mode. Bloctave is SEIS-approved in the UK and has attracted interest from angel investors. Our open SAFE round targets a $5 million pre-money valuation. We plan to allocate all grant funding to senior blockchain developers who will integrate the selected network‚Äôs infrastructure into our core application. Our wallet address for all funding-related operations is: 0xe5a4191EF009C3494d485a37Ee71B6AC91F20E15.
