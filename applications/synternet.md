Synternet

## üåü Project Overview

Synternet is pioneering the future of agentic commerce by creating the number one platform for permissionless agent-to-agent communication and microtransactions. The project addresses a fundamental gap in Web3 and beyond: enabling agents to seamlessly subscribe to services, exchange data, and transact autonomously. Synternet‚Äôs infrastructure supports a robust marketplace where agents can price, offer, and monetize their services transparently. The network already validates billions in wrapped asset values and serves critical roles for major blockchain players like tBTC, Rootstock, CoreDao, and LayerZero. With a decentralized architecture validated by 38 validators and a strong community ownership of its token supply, Synternet fosters a permissionless ecosystem for agent development and monetization. Its leadership, composed of veteran blockchain entrepreneurs and technologists from institutions such as Morgan Stanley, EY, Swisscom, and JPMorgan, is driving the project towards scalable adoption across DeFi and broader digital commerce.

## üîç Project Details

Synternet‚Äôs technology stack is built upon the Cosmos SDK for both its blockchain protocol and broker layer, with customized modules for authentication, authorization, and accounting. The broker network employs NATS for messaging and a proprietary caching layer to optimize agent interactions. Supporting agents utilize a flexible SDK compatible with Python, JavaScript, Rust, and Go, enabling integrations with a vast range of data sources such as DeFiLlama, CoinGecko, Ethereum, and Bitcoin. Syntoshi, Synternet‚Äôs retail-facing agent, leverages AI technologies including DuckDB, PyTorch, pgvector, and Transformers, while integrating PostgreSQL for advanced data retrieval and RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) workflows. The architecture is designed to facilitate agent-to-agent data sourcing and payment interoperability through microtransactions. Synternet explicitly does not aim to replace existing DeFi protocols or serve as a general-purpose L1/L2; rather, it provides the infrastructure to enhance agent-based interactions, data monetization, and cross-chain commerce.

## üß© Ecosystem Fit

Synternet enhances the Polkadot ecosystem by enabling seamless, real-time agent-to-agent collaboration and microtransaction capabilities. The platform‚Äôs target audiences include DeFi users seeking smarter tools, institutional players deploying whitelabel agents, and agent developers monetizing specialized services. Synternet directly addresses two major limitations in current agent frameworks: fragmented data sourcing and a lack of built-in monetization mechanisms. Competing projects like ElizaOS and various DeFAI agents struggle with adaptability, transparency, and payment systems. Synternet‚Äôs agent marketplace solves these issues by facilitating transparent data sourcing and enabling token-based microtransactions. This empowers a new generation of agents that can collaborate and monetize effectively within and across ecosystems. By abstracting cross-chain complexities and democratizing access to intelligent agents, Synternet accelerates DeFi adoption and increases transaction volume, thereby strengthening Polkadot‚Äôs position as a leader in decentralized agentic commerce.
